Getting set up
--------------

We use [Expensify](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expensify.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGpm5mx9v1hLOvSKTm5s7_iEpA4OA) to reimburse the work-related costs you'll incur.

You only need to create an account with your status.im email address, and Expensify will ask you to join the Status organization. Please input your full name as it appears in your BambooHR profile when setting up your Expensify account.\
You can download the Expensify app for when you're on the go.

How to submit an expense report
-------------------------------

-   Create `Expenses` in the left hand navigation
-   Add expenses to `Reports`
-   Submit `Reports` for review to <rajanie@status.im>

General guidance
----------------

You will always need to submit a receipt with each expense you log. Make sure to take photos or keep digital receipts handy - missing receipts might end up in your reports not being approved.

Please select a Category for each expense, and include a comment indicating how the expense is business-related, including any additional context that will help the expense reviewer identify that the expense is appropriate. As an example:

> -   Category: Events | Comment: "DEVCON CONFERENCE, Berlin - Taxi from LHR airport to conference with 1 other team member, Joe"
> -   Category: Coworking | Comment: "Coffee at cafe whilst coworking"
> -   Category: Meals & Drinks | Comment: "PEOPLE OPS TEAM MEETUP - Evening meal on May 26th with 3 others: Stef, Nabil, Ceri"

We typically reimburse expenses together with your salary payout, at the end of the month. If you incurred in particularly high costs and need the payment to come in earlier, get in touch with us and with your lead and we can check if it's possible to send you to reimburse off-cycle. All expenses must be submitted within two months of incurring the cost. Any expenses submitted late will not be reimbursed.

Please consider that each expense report submitted requires manual processing on the Finance side. We'd ask therefore that you accumulate trivial expenses up to a certain threshold before submitting them for reimbursement (e.g. minimum report total of EUR 50), as it would be a huge help to the Finance team.

If you have any questions about this process, please ping us in the #status-peopleops channel or email to <billing@status.im>
