(...there isn't one)

We don't mandate the days, schedule, or hours that you work - you're free to set your own working schedule, and work from any workspace (home/coffee shop/coworking space/gym) and timezone that works for you.

Status is a results-oriented workplace - meaning that we care about your output (the results you deliver), not your input (the number of hours you work).

This way of working might be new to you, and if you'd like some guidance on self-directed working, or have any concerns about being productive - feel free to chat to anyone on the People Ops team who will be happy to guide you.
