Send your invoice (in PDF format only) to <billing@status.im>, latest on the 20th.

Your invoicing period is the current calendar month (e.g. invoice by 20th October for your services in October).

You don't need to include your expenses in your invoice (these should be submitted separately via Expensify).

Your invoice should include:

-   Your legal name and address as per your agreement.
-   Status legal entity with which you have the services agreement.
-   The date range of the invoicing period according to your agreement (e.g. "1st March to 31st March").
-   Description of the service rendered and/or reference to your agreement.
-   The full fee stated and the fiat currency according to your agreement (in CHF, USD, EUR, ...)
-   The percentage and absolute amount you want to receive in crypto versus fiat.
-   Your wallet address (Ethereum public key, only one address may be indicated).
-   Your `Employee Number` as per your [BambooHR](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/) profile.

You can use this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjELS543ov1TIQ9hU1DMoencQPJPmqhxEkqd4Q9jdCA/edit#gid=790763898), but please remember to download the finished invoice as a PDF before sending it as an attachment to the <billing@status.im> mailbox.

Please address the invoice to the Status legal entity with which you have your agreement. The main Status Legal Entities are:

-   Status Research & Development GmbH, Baarerstrasse 10, 6302 Zug, Switzerland
-   Status Research & Development Deutschland GmbH, ℅ Cormoran GmbH, Am Zirkus 2, 10117 Berlin, Germany
-   Status Holdings Pte. Ltd., 24 Raffles Place, #10-05 Clifford Centre, Singapore 048621

There are exceptional cases where another legal entity applies. Then please apply the respective company and address as per your agreement.

### Hourly rate contractors

If you're paid on an hourly basis and need to estimate your hours in the remainder of the month and reconcile them in the next invoice (as you'll be invoicing by the 20th of each month), it's ok to do that, or you could carry forward actual hours to your next invoice.

If your fees have been agreed on an hourly rate basis, our monthly cap for hours billed is the lower of either the amount specified in your agreement with us, or the number of business days in the month x 8.5 hours per day, e.g.:

> A month with 23 workdays has an hourly billing cap of 23 * 8.5 hours = 195.5 hours

Please have a discussion with People Ops if you intend to bill over this amount.

### Bank and Wallet Details

Please maintain your details on your [BambooHR](https://statusim.bamboohr.com/) profile, if you have one. For simplicity, we allow only the indication of one wallet and one bank account (exception allowed if you have an intermediary bank). If you want to change the %age paid in ETH, DAI or SNT, you can directly edit it. Once you save it, it will send an approval request to @ceri - the reason for that being so that we get a notification that something's changed, and can update our payment records timely. Only after the approval has been given will your changes reflect in your BambooHR profile, and only then you can change your payment split preferences again. In order to make sure that your changes are considered for the current month, change your info until the 20th of each month. After the 20th of the month, you'll be notified by @ceri of your options (most likely that your change will become effective as of next month's payment cycle).

Please be sure that your employment contract or services agreement reflects your registered address for banking purposes, as we are sometimes asked by our bank to validate that banking details match contract details.

### Getting Paid in Crypto

If you are new to crypto payments and wallets, this [guide](https://support.mycrypto.com/) provides a good introduction.\
To secure your assets, a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or a Trezor is recommended.\
Don't be shy to ask your more experienced colleagues (on #status-peopleops) when you have questions about crypto payments and wallets. Not everyone starts with the same level of knowledge and building it up is part of working with Status.

Rate Calculation

For determining rates when paying in ETH / SNT to team members, the following two rates are established using coinmarketcap.com as a price source and the rate which is most attractive for the individual receiving crypto will be used:

1.  The average closing rate across the last five days of the invoiced period.\
    Or

2.  The current rate when payments are being issued.\
    Your split % preference can be changed monthly - just make sure to inform @Jason before you submit your next invoice so he can prepare the necessary adjustments.\
    Please do not state the absolute crypto amount in your invoice, but only the percentage you request to receive in crypto. The absolute amount will be calculated by the Finance team.

### Pro-rating the monthly amount

For your first month (if being paid on an annual or monthly basis), please pro-rate the amount in your invoice to reflect the actual days worked divided by the effective working days of that month, if you joined during the course of a month:

-   Example: If March has 22 working days (counting Mon-Fri) and you started on a Monday, March 12th, your monthly invoice amount will be {your monthly fee amount}/22 x 15.\
    For each subsequent month, please bill the flat monthly or annual/12 figure (regardless of the vacation/time off you took).
-   Example: You joined Status on March 12th. During April, you took 1 week of vacation. Your April invoice amount will be {your monthly stipend amount in full} or {your annual stipend amount}/12 .

### Switzerland and Germany employees

You will be paid via monthly payroll as calculated by our outsourced payroll partners. There is no need to submit an invoice for your monthly salary. Please maintain the percentages you wish to receive in crypto on your BambooHR profile, as payroll will be prepared based on the split you indicate there (no need to request separately to @jason).

### On-call compensation
If you take part in the [on-call rota](https://discuss.status.im/t/on-call-process-discuss-sign-up-until-feb-22/1038), you can bill a $200 flat fee for each week's assignment, in addition to $20 p/h for incident resolution time (excluding time spent on post mortems). Both amounts will be paid out in SNT.

You should aggregate all your assignment fees and incident resolution hours and add these to a quarterly invoice in advance of the SNT quarterly payout cycle, e.g.:

-   Add on call amounts for Jan-March to your March invoice, ready for payment with the Q2 (1 April) SNT amounts
-   Add on call amounts for April-June to your June invoice, ready for payment with the Q3 (1 July) SNT amounts, etc.
