title: People Ops x You
---
We want to make sure core contributors get the attention and support they need on their journey in Status.

With that in mind, People Ops is here as support resource. You can ping us when you need advice, just want to chat, or feel like bouncing ideas about on your plans. We’re here to support you so no topic is too big or too trivial.

People Ops is available any time, just ping #status-peopleops status channel - or you can DM us if you prefer a 1:1.

Don’t be a stranger! We’ll also be checking in with you from time to time too, to ask your opinion on how things are going and how to better support you and Status.

Cheers!
