Not sure where to start for getting budget and attendance approval? Follow these steps:

Team Budgets
------------

1. Each team has their own budget. As a starting point, check in with your team lead about the event/conference you want to attend, the business need for the event, and costs associated with the event. If the event/conference fits within the existing budget and is approved, you can take it from your team budget.
2. For transparency, please create a blog post about the event to share with the team.

Request Budget
--------------

Here are the steps for requesting budget if there isn't already funding available through your team:

1.  Create a proposal. The proposal should include the following:

-   Costs - Flight, accommodation, ground transport, event ticket, meals, etc.
-   Business justification - What is the business justification/ benefit to Status for your attending the conference.
-   If applicable: who else from Status should attend or is attending.

2. Submit the proposal to <people-ops@status.im> and cc your team lead. From there, the proposal will be reviewed. People Ops, Finance and your team lead will make any necessary comments or adjustments for approval or denial.
3.  If your proposal is approved, then please submit a blog post with all the details of the event to Discuss to let people know you will be attending.

FAQ

### What happened to the Conference Budget that was previously available?

We've removed that policy for the time being whilst we're still in financial battle mode - it didn't make sense to allow for automatic approval of trips while we're making considered decisions on all of our spending across the board. As such, attending conferences is now covered under this general `Events`policy - we'd still like to support people in their professional development endeavours where possible, but we should make more careful decisions around that.
