Background
----------

As a Meritocracy, Status aims to reward leaders who deliver the greatest impact to the organization. At the same time, individuals who take on positions of leadership are often unclear on their responsibilities.

A [brainstorm session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMH4QMYPaRHEkWMwE7H1JlnHDariVA4C0qeMvdJ6kLE/edit#bookmark=id.w5rmmc7fuouk) was held on the 1 May 2019 to discuss leadership at Status, with a summary and resulting proposal outlined below.

Swarms Leads in Q2 2019
------------------

Preamble:

-   This is a flexible and imperfect proposal, something we can try for now as we move towards the DAO.
-   All swarms and their structures should be revisited every quarter and adjusted accordingly.
    -   i.e. The list of swarms below are set for Q2 2019, and can be adjusted in Q3 as swarms are created/merged/disbanded
-   Each lead has the responsibilities defined below
    -   *Note:* There are edge cases where a couple swarm leads will not have all the responsibilities from the first day. We need to be pragmatic before we overburden certain swarm leads (i.e. Core and Core UI) with additional work.

The list of swarm leads in Q2:
