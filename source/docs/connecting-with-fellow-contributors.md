In this exciting new post-Slack world, here's the lowdown on how you can stay connected.

Find people using the Status Direct directory
---------------------------------------------

The directory is [here](https://people-ops.status.im/status-direct/). To get yourself listed, please add your Status contact code to the `Personal` tab in your BambooHR profile. This info will then automatically sync through to Status Direct.

Demystify anonymous animal names
--------------------------------

The three word anonymised profile names in Status are based on a random name [deriving](https://discuss.status.im/t/choosing-a-unique-three-word-name/613) from your public key. Disorientated and can't tell your breams from your broncos? Check out (and add yourself to!) [this](https://notes.status.im/Zt0Lo2r8R9S7pZC1PLn06A) list of core contributors and their anonymous names/ENS usernames.

Get an ENS username

------------------

Here's a [list](https://notes.status.im/status-channels) of where people are gathering and chatting in Status. Hop on, or spin up your own discussion.
